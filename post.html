                    <p>There are around 15,000 Google Searches for ‘cryptocurrency’ every month in India. This is quite low compared to the 40,500 Google Searches every month in the United States</p>

                    <p>In scale, this clearly represents two things: a great lack of awareness and a great opportunity.</p>

                    <p>Koinex is a new upcoming cryptocurrency exchange in India which looks highly promising. It is currently inviting people to subscribe for its exclusive launch of the Alpha release.</p>

                    <p>The features that they have listed on their website (some of which are lightning fast, solid security, highly competitive transaction fee, user-friendly interface and multiple payment options) seem to be everything that you might want from an exchange.</p>

                    <p>Acquiring cryptocurrency is only the first step towards building a blockchain enabled India. There is scope for more applications than there are actual blockchain use cases. In this context, registering with the best exchange will take you there before anyone else.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Where to find Koinex?</h2>

                    <p>If you want to reach out to them, all you need to do is drop a mail at team@koinex.in and check out their website koinex.in to see the latest <a href="https://koinex.in">ethereum price</a> to sign up for the Alpha release. They also have a resource collection called Koinex Crunch, for people interested in cryptocurrency trading and want to learn stuff. Check out the blog at <a href="https://medium.com/koinex-crunch">Koinex Crunch</a>.</p>

                    <p>The future of blockchain based cryptocurrencies is bright and I am confident that blockchain is the way ahead. Decentralised and hybrid apps will take over the market in the coming years. For that you need to be prepared to have some cryptocurrencies in your kitty. Very soon companies might even start paying salaries in bitcoin/ethers or other cryptocurrencies.</p>

                    <blockquote>Buterin believes Ethereum has several advantages, including its capability of being an underbed for diverse applications: digital property, financial contracts, registration of non-finance data, data storage, and so on. He also noted that development of such applications would be easy and fast.</blockquote>

                    <p>You make money from money. Like everything else in business and trading, cryptocurrency will make you money if you know the what, the where, the when, and the how.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                    <p>You need to pick which cryptocurrencies you want to put your money in. The money here is the legal tender of your country. There can be various ways to select a cryptocurrency to invest in. Depending on your personal trading style, you can play a safe bet and invest in the most popular, strongest cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.). Or you can take a high risk, high gain bet and invest in other alternate coins (like BAT, Golem etc.).</p>

                    <p>Ethereum is considered a very broad programming platform where a developer can build games, financial applications, gambling apps, insurance companies, social networks, and pretty much everything we already use today. However, Ethereum is run off a decentralized system which means there is no main authority holding all the information that’s used to create those applications.</p>

                    <p>Imagine a network or community of computers linked together throughout the globe. These computers verify each other’s work, anyone can run programs on them, and users can pay for only what they wish to use. This is how the Ethereum platform works.</p>
